  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Established in <strong>1995</strong>, Prasad Jewellers began as a humble family
    tradition rooted in trust, purity, and craftsmanship.
    <br><br>
    For nearly three decades, we have specialised in creating traditional gold and
    silver jewellery that reflects cultural heritage and timeless design.
    <br><br>
    We believe jewellery is not just an ornament, but a memory passed across generations.
    That is why we follow a <strong>made-to-order</strong> approach — every piece is crafted
    only after you place your order, exactly as per your design preference.
    <br><br>
    Our journey since 1995 is built on long-term relationships, transparent purity,
    and the skill of experienced artisans who handcraft every piece with care.
